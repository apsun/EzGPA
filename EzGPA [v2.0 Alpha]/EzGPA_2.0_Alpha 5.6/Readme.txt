Q: The app doesn't start!
A: Try (re)installing .NET Framework 2.0 (the version should be v2.0.50727)

Q: The app crashes when I try to start it!
A: If you have previously used EzGPA v1.7 (including all sub-versions, like 1.7.1), try deleting HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\EzGPA.

Q: I still get errors when I load the app!
A: These messages are caused by registry problems.
Make sure you have sufficient rights to run the app (try running as Administrator).
If that doesn't help, make sure you have read/write access to the HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\EzGPA key.
If it still doesn't work, navigate to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software and delete the EzGPA subkey.
If it STILL doesn't work, try adding EzGPA to your anti-virus's exception list.
Still out of luck? Send me the error message and when the error occurs.

Q: How do you do any of that stuff?
A: Google.com

Q: The app doesn't work.
A: Sucks for you.

Q: THe app crashes when I do [something]. I am using [something] and I have the latest .NET 2 version.
A: Send me a message and I'll try to fix it. Screenshots would be appreciated too.

Q: Are you sure this is 100% accurate?
A: No. The result is only checked against my own GPA.
Although I would appreciate it if you told me that my dataz are wrong, so I can eat/fix them.

Q: Can I have the source code?
A: I will release it sometime in the future.
Or you could just decompile the app if you want it now, it's up to you.

Q: How often do you update this app?
A: As often as I need it.
If I have new features, whenever they're done. If not, once per school year.

Q: What happened to the Chinese option?
A: I'm lazy. Plus, I suck at Chinese.

Q: Is it safe if I delete/modify the registry keys for EzGPA? Will it screw up my computer?
A: It's safe. I do it all the time to check for bugs in my code, so I'm way ahead of you :p

Q: When will you release v2.0 final?
A: When it's ready. (That means when pigs can fly on the moon.)
If youhen the source code is released, go and build it yourself (just change DEBUG_MODE to true).

Q: EzGPA screwed up my computer! It's a virus!
A: To fix this, delete system32, and then rub your hard drive with a magnet to get rid of the virus.

Q: Why did you re-write the entire app?
A: Same reason as Cat Mario v2, I was bored and wanted a challenge.

Q: What programming language is EzGPA written in?
A: Depends on the version.
v1.0 - v1.7.5 was written in VB.NET.
v1.4 had a version written in VB6 (project is now abandoned)
v2.0 was written in C#.NET.

Q: My GPA is off.
A: First, check that all of your levels are correct (*glares at Jerry*) and and you made no typos.
If you are 100% sure all data is correct, send me a list of your scores, levels, and GPAs and I'll look into it.

Q: Can I decompile your app, remove your name from the credits, compile it and distribute it?
A: Can I break into your house, steal all of your possessions, and call it my own?

Q: Can I decompile your app, improve it, add my name to the credits, compile it and distribute it?
A: Sure, as long as you don't add advertising/viruses.

Q: What happened to the settings?
A: I thought about it, and decided that they were pretty useless, so I removed them.
