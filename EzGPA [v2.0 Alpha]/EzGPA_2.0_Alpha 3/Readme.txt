Q: The app doesn't start!
A: Try (re)installing .NET Framework 2.0 (the version should be v2.0.50727)

Q: It keeps showing "An error occured while loading/saving user settings: ..."!
A: Make sure you have sufficient rights to run the app (try running as Administrator).
If that doesn't help, make sure you have read/write access to the HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\EzGPA key.
If it still doesn't work, natigate to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software and delete the EzGPA subkey.

Q: How do you do that stuff?
A: Google it.

Q: Your app sux...
A: Go make your own then.

Q: Are you sure this is 100% accurate?
A: No. The result is only checked against my own GPA.

Q: Can I have the source code?
A: Well, I already released large chunks of it on my blog...

Q: Something is wrong with your app!
A: Something is wrong with your brain!

Q: How often do you update this app?
A: As often as I need it. If I have new features, whenever I want. If not, once per school year.

Q: What happened to the Chinese option?
A: I'm lazy. That part was a pain to implement, and I don't want to do it again. Sorry...

Q: Is Twilight Sparkle really best pony?
A: Yes.

Q: Is it safe if I delete the registry keys for EzGPA?
A: Absolutely. I delete/modify them all the time to check for bugs, so I'm way ahead of you :p

Q: When will the app be released?
A: When I want to release it... Duh...

Q: How long did it take you to write this app?
A: All of the versions combined? Maybe ~50 hours. The C# version (v2.0)? About 10 hours.

Q: Are you going to release the debug version too, or just the normal version?
A: ...Why the heck would you need the debug version? I mean, it's not even that useful...
