# EzGPA

This was a project I worked on from 8th grade to 11th grade, used for
calculating your GPA at Shanghai High School Int'l Division. It contains
some of the earliest (and worst) code that I've ever written.

It's a real trip down memory lane. You can clearly see the progress in
coding ability as the version numbers get higher.

## Version history (as best as I can)

| Version | Language         | Release date   |

\* Never actually released, this is my best estimate

I'm not sure what happened to versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.3.
